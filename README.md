Java Project Name:  IC05_IsDivisible

A number x is divisible by a number y if the remainder after the division is zero.  Write a Java console application that tests whether one number is divisible by another number.  Read both numbers from the keyboard and output whether (or not) the first number is divisible by the second.

An example dialog:

Please enter a number for x:  5
Please enter a number for y:  3

5 is not divisible by 3
